# roman-number-converter
Program for converting Roman numerals to standard numbers, and vice versa.

This Python program asks the user to input either a Roman numeral or a regular number. Regardless of the type of value entered, the program checks if it's between 1 and 3999; if it falls outside of this range, the user is prompted to enter a new number.

When the user enters a Roman numeral, the program goes through each of the numeral's letters, determines the letter's value using a hash map, and adds the value to a pre-defined variable with each iteration. Once the enter Roman numeral has been traversed, the program returns the number equivalent to the user and asks if they'd like to perform a new conversion.

When the user enters a regular number, (tbd)
