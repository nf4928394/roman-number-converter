### Summary
Program for converting Roman numerals to standard numbers, and vice versa.

### Further details

This Python program asks the user to input either a Roman numeral or a regular number. Depending on the type of input entered, a function is called to perform the conversion, which is then displayed to the user. The program is limited to values between 1 and 3999.

The program's code can be found in the file `converter.py`. Please see [the Wiki tab](https://github.com/nf4928394/roman-number-converter/wiki) for function explanations and test cases.
