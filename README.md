# Roman Numeral/Number Converter

*(Note: project is still in development. Anticipated V1 completion date of January 14th 2022, with future updates planned!)*

### Summary
Program for converting Roman numerals to standard numbers, and vice versa.

### Further details

This Python program asks the user to input either a Roman numeral or a regular number. Depending on the type of input entered, a function is called to perform the conversion, which is then displayed to the user. The program limits the user to conversions of values between 1 and 3999.

The program's code can be found in the file `converter.py`. Please see the Wiki tab for function explanations and test cases.
