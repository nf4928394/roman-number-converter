# Roman Numeral/Number Converter

(Note: project is still in development. Anticipated completion date of January 7th, 2022)

### Summary
Program for converting Roman numerals to standard numbers, and vice versa.

### Further details

This Python program asks the user to input either a Roman numeral or a regular number. Regardless of the type of value entered, the program checks if it's between 1 and 3999; if it falls outside of this range, the user is prompted to enter a new number.

The program's code can be found in the file 'converter.py'. Please see the Wiki section for my notes showing how I planned and subsequently built the program's functions.

Thank you for viewing my project!
